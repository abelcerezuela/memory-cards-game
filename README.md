# Memory cards game
Mobile application inspired on the "Memory Cards" game.

**Memory Cards** is a memory-based game where the player must remember the positions of numbers from 1 to 9 displayed briefly on a grid of 9 squares. After the numbers disappear, the player is asked to find a specific number's position. If they guess correctly, they earn points and continue playing. If they guess wrong, the game ends.
